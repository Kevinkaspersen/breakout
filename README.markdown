To run the program you simply press the run button (looks like a play button) in the right corner.
If you need to access it thru a terminal simply path your way to the directory the file is in.  
Then write "python breakout.py" to run the file, this may be different depending on which terminal you use.

There is also possibilites to alter how many rows and columns you want, this will change the amount of blocks you have to break to win the game.
This is simply done by navigating to "#Rows and columns" in the code file and modify the values "rows = a number" and "columns = a number"

When the program is running, simply follow the instruction on the game screen.
To exit the game just press the regular exit button in the right corner.

This projects developments has stopped, but there are still possibilites for upgrading the program, by adding more levels, strenght for different blocks and powerups.
